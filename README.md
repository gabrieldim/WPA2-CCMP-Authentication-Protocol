# WPA2-CCMP-Authentication-Protocol ( Information security )
CCMP authentication protocol in Java programming language.
To create this stimulation of the protocol I used 5 classes and used my knowledge of network security and code writing skills in Java.
- The Main class is actually the class in which all classes merge and execute. According to the practice so far, I used this class only to test the functionality of the whole code.
- FrameHeader's class contains the source and destination MAC address. I used fictitious values for these addresses so that I could execute the code completely.
- The whole logic of the methods is in the WP2SimulationECB class. In this class I keep four methods, two of which are auxiliary and are used in the main methods of encryption and decryption.
- ClearTextFrame stores unencrypted data.
- EncryptedFrame is a class for storing encrypted data. <br>
